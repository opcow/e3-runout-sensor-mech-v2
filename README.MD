The switch I used came out of a computer mouse. It should be fairly simple to make a housing to fit other types of switches.

The coupler used is the kind that goes in the hotend. This size will let the TPFE tubing pass through. If you don't have one you can print the included coupler STLs. Alternatively, there is a simple guide that doesn't use a piece of tubing.

This design uses a modified [Ender 3 Filament Roller Guide](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3052488) to mount to the printer.

Everything can be printed without supports.
